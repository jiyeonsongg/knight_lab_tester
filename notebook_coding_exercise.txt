Given a settings file containing storage liquid info and a metadata file containing the lot number of the storage liquid used for each biological sample in an experiment, write a python jupyter notebook to create a tab-separated-value output file that extends the metadata file by adding columns of the appropriate mass_storage_liquid_in_g value for each sample, the appropriate density_storage_liquid_in_g_per_mL value for each sample, and the appropriate calculated volume_storage_liquid_in_L value for each sample (look up the mass/density/volume relationship if you don't know it; units are in the column names). If your notebook requires *any* libraries that are not part of the basic distribution of python 3.9+, include information on what they are and how to install them.

Please do not seek help on this exercise from any other live humans.  This is "open book" so you are not forbidden from getting help from web search resources or even from ChatGPT *but* please note in your response which elements of it came from which resources.
